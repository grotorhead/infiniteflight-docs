# Instrument Landing System (ILS) Approach



## What is an ILS Approach?

The ILS consists of two beams, the Localizer (LOC), providing lateral guidance (left/right) and the Glideslope (G/S) providing vertical guidance (up/down). The cone at the end of a runway provides a **VISUAL AID** for both pilots and Controllers of where the LOC and G/S are, however it is important to remember that the LOC and G/S are not confined to the cone. The LOC and G/S are independent radio ‘signals’ that are sent out, and thus continue to go out. Aircraft can receive these signals and therefore intercept them - both within the cone or outside of the cone.



To intercept the LOC of an ILS, Controllers will issue aircraft with an intercept heading which will be as close to 30 degrees as possible, offset from the runway designator *(see 6.10.3.1 below)*. If aircraft have an appropriate STAR and/or Instrument Approach, aircraft may be issued an ILS approach clearance at an appropriate position without an assigned heading or the standard 30 degree intercept.

To intercept the G/S of an ILS, Controllers will issue an altitude that is below the G/S path *(see 6.10.4.1 below).* The typical G/S follows a 3 degree flight path angle that guides the aircraft to the runway threshold. At 1nm the G/S altitude would be 300ft AAL (above aerodrome level); at 2nm, 600ft AAL and so on.

## How do I fly an ILS Approach?

Step 1

: En-route to your destination, check the ATIS/D-ATIS for runway(s) in use



Tip

: It is common to be given vectors and/or altitude assignments during the approach, make sure to follow these - ATC instructions supersede your Flight Plan!



Step 2

: Tune to the ILS by following our step by step guide [here](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-an-ils)



Step 3

: If you are no longer following your flight plan or [GPS Navigation](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#gps-navigation) is no longer required, you can display the ILS by following our step by step guide [here](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-an-ils-in-your-aircraft)



Step 4

: If ATC is active, you will require a clearance to join the ILS Approach. This will either be in the form of joining from your STAR/Instrument Approach or with an intercept heading



Tip

: Feel overloaded? Reduce your workload by engaging the [Autopilot](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) and APPR mode, the aircraft will maintain the assigned heading and then automatically intercept the LOC and G/S. Make sure to only arm APPR mode once you have been cleared for the approach!



Step 5

: To follow the LOC, ensure that the green Localizer Deviation Bar is inline with the green Course Select Pointer on your HSI. Once this is within 1 dot of lateral deviation, you are established - when no conflict exists, you will then be handed over to Tower from Radar (if ATC is active), do not change frequency without permission!



Step 6

: To follow the G/S, ensure that the green Glideslope Deviation Dot is inline with the central marker by the altitude on your HUD



Tip

: Do not descend on the G/S until you are established on the LOC!



Step 7

: Continue to monitor both your LOC and G/S deviation and make the adjustments required to keep these centralized. At the appropriate point, based on speed control by ATC and the recommended profile for your aircraft type; continue to configure to meet the Stability Approach Criteria



## What is the Stability Approach Criteria (SAC)?

The Stability Approach Criteria (SAC) is there to access if you have flown a stable approach, and whether to continue to land or go-around.



All approaches must meet the SAC by 1000ft AGL (above ground level). The SAC are:



- In the planned landing configuration
- Stabilized on the correct vertical profile
- Stabilized at the target approach speed




If any of the SAC are not met, a [go-around](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/go-around-baulked-landing#go-around%2Fbaulked-landing) must be flown.



Once your final configuration has been selected and you have decelerated to your target approach speed, we recommend remaining  within the following tolerances in order to access your stability:



| Parameter            | Tolerance                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Speed                | Target Approach Speed -5/+10 kts         |
| Vertical Speed       | No more than 1000ft/min*                 |
| Pitch                | No more than -2.5 degrees nose down or +10 degrees nose up |
| Bank                 | Angle not exceeding 7 degrees            |
| Localizer/Glideslope | No more than 1 dot of lateral/vertical deviation |

**Environmental conditions such as a tailwind, or a steeper than usual flight path angle could increase the descent rate required to more than 1000ft/min*
