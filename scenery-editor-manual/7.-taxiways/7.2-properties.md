# 7.2 Properties

### 7.2.1

Step 1

: Select the taxiway by tapping on or near the taxiway *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the taxiway from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the taxiway will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen

Step 4

: You can then adjust the following properties for taxiways:

| Button                | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |

| Direction             | Two Way, Forward, Backward and None can be selected          | See [7.2.5](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-taxiways/7.2-properties#7.2.5) below |
| Line Type             | Various types of lines can be selected                       | See [7.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-taxiways/7.2-properties#7.2.2) below |
| Taxiway Network Usage | Unknown, Aircraft or None can be selected                    | See [7.2.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-taxiways/7.2-properties#7.2.3) below |
| Lights Type           | Various types of lights can be selected                      | See [7.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-taxiways/7.2-properties#7.2.2) below |
| Latitude / Longitude  | Current latitude/longitude of the taxiway                    | This **should not**{.red} be changed                         |
| Altitude              | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the taxiway. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | The altitude is always based on the elevation of the airport (this **should not**{.red} be changed) |
| Name                  | You can name the taxiway using this field                    | All taxiways **must**{.red} be named appropriately (i.e. "A" for Alpha taxiway). See [7.2.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-taxiways/7.2-properties#7.2.4) below |



### 7.2.2

Below are the different types of lines, lights and categories available. Lines **must**{.red} only be added when they are present IRL (details are usually found within the Airport Operational Information or ground charts):

## Taxiway Network Usage

### 7.2.3

The purpose of the "Taxiway Network Usage" property is to identify any lines that could be used in ATC communication with aircraft (such as hold lines or centerlines). The table below outlines when to use the different usage types:



| Usage Type | Part of Taxiway Network? | Use                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unknown    | Not in use               | Not in use                                                   |
| Aircraft   | Yes                      | Centerlines and Runway Hold lines*                           |
| None       | No                       | Stop bars, taxiway edge lines, roadways, gate outlines, runway turnaround lines and other hold lines** |

**Only the Runway Hold lines closest to the runway **must** be included in the taxiway network by setting the Usage Type to "Aircraft"* 

***All other hold lines including ILS holds **must not** be included in the taxiway network*



## Naming Lines

### 7.2.4

Tip

: The in-app keyboard is the best tool for naming lines and can be accessed by tapping "Taxiways > Keyboard". It will also remember your last few selections for quick access and it will default to upper case when entered



Step 1

: Select the line by tapping on or near it, you may have to select the line from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



> You can rename multiple lines at the same time by tapping "Edit > Selection Add" and then selecting all the lines you want to be renamed



Tip

: Tap "Freeze Non Taxi Lines" to help avoid selecting anything other than lines with a taxiway network usage type of aircraft (to unfreeze again, tap "Edit > Unfreeze All")



Step 2

: Name the line by using the in-app keyboard or by accessing the "Properties" tab and then tapping "Name"



| Type                                          | Name                                                         | Notes                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Named Taxiway Centerlines                     | **Must**{.red} be named exactly the same as IRL on the charts (e.g. A, B etc.) |                                                              |
| Unnamed Taxiway Centerlines/Parking Positions | **Must**{.red} be named as APRON                             | To avoid typing this out manually, you can tap "Taxiways > Set as Apron" to do this for all selected lines |
| Hold Lines                                    | **Must**{.red} be named exactly the same as the runway it serves (e.g. 04R-22L). This applies to both runway and ILS holds. If the holds are assigned different names IRL, these can also be added (such as PLUTO at EGLL) | Tap "Taxiways > Auto Assign Holds" to automatically assign all holds to the nearest runway (if there are multiple runways in close proximity, they may not be labelled correctly using this function) |

> Only lines with their "Taxiway Network Usage" set as "Aircraft" will be recognised. Therefore any lines that are set as "Unknown" or "None" do not need to be named



Tip

: Tap "Select Invalid Taxilines" to show lines in magenta that have invalid names



### 7.2.5

When naming the curved lines that connect two or more taxiways, consideration **must**{.red} be given to how the labels are used with Controllers and Pilots, and particularly, how this would look on a map if the taxi routing given was drawn out. For example, if there is a long taxiway named "M", and multiple smaller taxiways join this taxiway, the curves will be named the same as the smaller connecting taxiways. This is because if an aircraft was instructed to taxi on "M", it would be a straight line and not have curved lines at every intersection.



## Taxiway Direction

### 7.2.6

All taxiways **must**{.red} be "TwoWay" unless:



- It is a self-positioning stand (such as at EGLC)
- If a runway exit does not have a hold line
- Or if the taxiway is marked as one way or has a no entry sign (not including if the direction is related to runway configuration)



Tip

: The direction for forward will follow the node numbers with 0 as the starting point, the reverse is the case for backward. Editors may have to select the "opposite" of what they would expect as it is based on the node numbering
