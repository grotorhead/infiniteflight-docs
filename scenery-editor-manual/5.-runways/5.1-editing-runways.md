> If the new runway has ILS in real life, it **must**{.red} be added in Infinite Flight as well. In order to do that, open a Reviewer ticket in the IFAET Discord server, and notify them of the new runway with ILS at your airport.  



## Editing an Existing Runway

### 5.1.2

Step 1

: Select the runway by tapping on or near the line, you may have to select the runway from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap the "Modify Shape" button on the right side **(1)**



Step 3

: The runway's nodes will appear



Step 4

: By tapping a node it will turn magenta **(2)** to show it has been selected *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Step 6

: When editing is complete, tap "Modify Shape" to deselect it (you will be unable to edit other objects without doing this) 



> If the modified runway has ILS in real life, the ILS properties **must**{.red} modified in Infinite Flight as well. In order to do that, open a Reviewer ticket in the IFAET Discord server, and notify them of the modified runway with ILS at your airport. 



## Moving/Changing Orientation of a Runway

### 5.1.3

Step 1

: Select the runway by tapping on or near the runway *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the runway from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The runway's name will appear to indicate it has been selected **(1)**

Step 3

| Outer  | Will change the orientation of the taxiway by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |
