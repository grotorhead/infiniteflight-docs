# 11.1 Gate Equipment Placement



When constructing your gate, please ensure that items are not overused as this can result in performance degradation as well as giving off the appearance that things may have been copy and pasted. Keep gates unique and change up the orientation of objects. 



Try to limit the repetition of certain objects within close proximity of each other. Please see quantities for each object as applicable.



Example of:



- G/A
- Cargo
- Commercial (Gate and Remote)
- Military
- Maintenance



Include bits about not attaching tow bars to tugs and always putting containers on top of pallet dolleys

Not crossing a white line

No pushback tugs right in front of the nose gear
