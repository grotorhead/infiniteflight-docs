# 10.2 Selection and Placement



## Selecting and Placing an Object

### 10.2.1

Step 1

Step 2

: Select the object you wish to place by tapping it **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want to add the object to (you may have to press and hold), this will place a white cursor **(2)**. Adjust this as required and then tap "Add Object" **(3)**



Tip

: You might need to "freeze" lines and pavements to avoid these being selected when tapping on your screen. To do this tap "Edit > Freeze All Lines / Freeze All Pavements"

| Top (just above center circle) | Will adjust the elevation or altitude of the object          |
| Outer                          | Will change the orientation of the object by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |
