# 10.5 Model Lines



### 10.5.1

Using the "Model Line" tool, you can add a series of objects along a line. Each line section **must**{.red} be at least as long as the object you are adding to it (e.g. if one section of fence is 4m long, the model line needs to be at least 4m) otherwise the object will stick out. Use this to create long portions of fencing.



Tip

: Whenever you connect buildings/lines/pavements, you **must**{.red} use the "Snap" function to avoid gaps and/or overlapping *(see [2.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.4) above)*  



## Creating a Model Line

### 10.5.2

Step 1

: Tap "Object" and then "Create Model Line" **(1)**



Step 2

: The properties tab will open on the right of the screen, choose the object you want to use for the model line by tapping "Model Ref Name" and then selecting the desired object from the list



Step 3

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want a model line **(2)**, the first node will be placed



Step 4

: Continue to tap to add nodes **(3)**, a model line will continue to be drawn between the nodes

## Editing an Existing Model Line

### 10.5.3



Step 1

: Select the model line by tapping on or near the line, you may have to select the model line from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap the "Modify Shape" button on the right side **(1)**



Step 3

: The line will turn magenta when selected and nodes will appear



Step 4

: By tapping a node it will turn magenta **(2)** to show it has been selected *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Step 6

: When editing is complete, tap "Modify Shape" to deselect it (you will be unable to edit other model lines without doing this)

## Moving/Changing Orientation of a Model Line

### 10.5.4



Step 1

: Select the model line by tapping on or near the model line *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the model line from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the model line will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Tip

: If you have only just made the model line then just tap "Modify Shape" to deselect this and the model line will be selected



Step 3

: Two circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Tap and hold on the circle **(2)** to move the model line or to change orientation:



| Circle | Function                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Center | Will move the model line by dragging your finger to the desired location |
| Outer  | Will change the orientation of the model line by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |

## Model Line Properties

### 10.5.5

Step 1

: Select the model line by tapping on or near the model line *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the model line from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the model line will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)** 



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen



![Image 10.5.5.1 - Changing Model Line Properties](_images/manual/frames/9.5.5.1a.png)



Step 4

: You can then adjust the following properties:



| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Model Ref Name       | Tap to select the object you want to be paced with the model line | Only use fences or similar at this time                      |
| Spacing              | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the spacing between objects  | This needs to be same as the length of the fence segment (i.e. 12.00 for a 12m fence) |
| Orientation Offset   | Tap the "+/-" symbols to rotate the objects on the line around their individual center | The default offset of 90.0 will ensure fences are joined properly (it is recommended not to change this) |
| Center Offset        | Tap the "+/-" symbols to shift the objects away from the zero node | This needs to half the length of the fence segment (i.e 3.00 for a 6m fence) |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the object                     |                                                              |
| Altitude             | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the model line. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | Altitudes of model lines cannot be changed                   |
| Name                 | You can name the model line using this field                 |                                                              |



## Deleting a Model Line

### 10.5.6

Step 1

: Select the model line by tapping on or near the model line *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the model line from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the model line will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap "Delete Selection" from the edit buttons **(2)** on the right side of the screen

## Splitting Model Lines

### 10.5.7

In some cases, it might be necessary to create new model lines at corners to ensure proper alignment of the object. It is recommended to always start with one long model line drawn, and then use the "split" function to break the model line up (to avoid having to create lots of separate model lines manually), follow the steps below to do this:



Step 1

: Tap the model line that you want to split and then "Modify Shape" on the right of the screen



Step 2

: Select the node that you want to split



Step 3

: Tap "Split Line"
