# 12.2 Editor Checklist

Tip

: If help or guidance is needed before an airport is complete, Editors **should**{.red} utilize the *#help* Discord channel to ask specific questions related to their airport



### 12.2.1

Below is a checklist that editors **should**{.red} ensure is completed before marking an airport as complete and ready for review:



> If you leave this page, items that you have "checked off" will not be remembered. Do not navigate away or refresh this page until you have completed the checklist (or particular section of the checklist such as "Taxiways")



## Airport Properties

### 12.2.2

- [ ] All airport properties have been set
- [ ] All ATC frequencies have been added
- [ ] Scenery check has been carried out by tapping "File > Scenery Stats > Scenery Check > Check Scenery" and any errors listed (that need to be fixed) have been corrected



## Airport Boundary

### 12.2.3

- [ ] Anything outside of airport boundary has been removed (except for applicable airport equipment)

- [ ] Longer fences are added using the "Model Line" tool to ensure they are joined properly and their orientations are consistent
- [ ] Correct fence selection has been made i.e. barb-wire vs no barb-wire
- [ ] When using the barb-wire fence, ensure that it is the correct orientation
- [ ] Motorized gates have been added at roadway entrances and exits (where applicable)



## Airport Equipment

### 12.2.4

- [ ] Airport beacon tower has been added (if applicable) in the position found IRL
- [ ] The beacon light has been added (if applicable) to the same location as the airport beacon/ATC tower

- [ ] VORs have been added to the 3D airport if present IRL (utilizing available imagery and airport charts)
- [ ] VOR sizing correctly portrays what is at the airport IRL i.e. VOR (small) or VOR has been placed within the airport boundary

- [ ] Runway guard lights (if applicable) have been provided at all applicable runway intersections 
- [ ] Runway guard lights are oriented respective to their IRL conditions either following straight taxi center lines or curved center lines so that they are visible to the PIC

- [ ] Localizers have been added in the position found IRL and in the correct orientation (i.e. box facing away from the runway end)
- [ ] Slope Antennas have been added in the position found IRL and oriented with the runway heading

- [ ] Wind socks are provided as close to IRL imagery and airport chart data (if available)
- [ ] ATC towers have been place in the position found IRL, and have the correct height set
- [ ] The tower view point is placed within the ATC tower cab



## Pavements

### 12.2.5

- [ ] All pavements found IRL have been added

- [ ] All pavements have the same surface type as found IRL

  > All hangars **must**{.red} have a concrete pavement added underneath the hangar unless it is a different surface type (based on real life sources)

- [ ] All pavements have been snapped without gaps

- [ ] Pavement patches are added on top of the surrounding pavements (i.e. no hole created underneath)

  > If there is a more performance efficient way (i.e. less nodes created) then this is acceptable (at the Reviewers discretion). E.g. snapping a pavement patch to the edge of the pavement rather than placing it on top, or allowing holes to be created underneath

- [ ] Grass surface type is only used for grass taxiways (e.g. not used for grass outside a terminal)



## Taxiways

### 12.2.6

- [ ] All taxiway lines found IRL have been added
  - [ ] Centerlines
  - [ ] Hold lines
  - [ ] Edge lines
  - [ ] Road and gate outlines
  
- [ ] All taxiway lines have the correct line types assigned as found IRL

- [ ] All taxiway lines have the correct light type assigned as found IRL

  > Don't add centerline lights to stand lines unless specifically stated in available airport documents 

- [ ] All taxiway lines are snapped

- [ ] All taxiway centerlines and hold lines have been named

- [ ] Only taxiway centerlines and hold lines have the taxiway network usage type set to aircraft

- [ ] All other lines have the taxiway network usage type set to none

- [ ] All taxiway centerlines have the aircraft category set to the largest aircraft category that can use that taxiway

- [ ] All taxiway centerlines have the directions correctly set

- [ ] All taxiway connectors are placed (as required)

- [ ] Taxiway network has been built and checked

- [ ] "Taxiway Routes Available" tick box selected (orange tick when selected) by tapping "File > Airport Properties > Taxiway Routes Available"



## Start Locations

### 12.2.7

- [ ] Start locations are added for all parking positions as found IRL
- [ ] Start locations have the correct orientation
- [ ] Start locations have been appropriately named in both the "gate" & "terminal" text fields
- [ ] Start locations have the aircraft category set to the largest aircraft category that can use that start location
- [ ] Gate stops have been defined (as required)



## Buildings and Facades

### 12.2.8

- [ ] Buildings have been added respective to their locations IRL

- [ ] Building heights and roof depths appear realistic 

- [ ] Buildings are aligned with 2D Pavements

- [ ] Building layering is symmetrical and corners are accurately positioned at all intersections

  > Any level that is not the top floor or the lowest layer of a floating building (such as a bridge) should have the roof type set to "none"

- [ ] Roof orientations have been auto coordinated

- [ ] Facades are coordinated as close to IRL as possible

- [ ] Rooftop equipment such as air conditioners, cooling towers, ladders and catwalks have been positioned reflecting their position IRL

- [ ] Duplicate buildings have been removed if "Download OSM" and "Download OSM at Cursor" were utilized



## Objects

### 12.2.9

- [ ] Objects arenâ€™t overcrowding ramps, gates, parking lots and staging areas

- [ ] No objects are clipping one another

- [ ] Vehicles are clear and free from roadways

- [ ] Objects are clear from obstructing jet bridges movement areas

- [ ] Lighting has been added respective to their locations IRL

- [ ] Firefighting trainer aircraft (if applicable) has been added



## Airport Gates

### 12.2.10

- [ ] Stand guidance added to any gates that have it IRL
- [ ] Check that all jet bridges are assigned to gates
- [ ] Ensure that Jet Bridges are set to a height that will accommodate aircraft according to the gate spawn size
- [ ] Verify that the jet bridge is assigned only to the gates that it is to service (i.e. not assigned to gates on the other side of the terminal)
- [ ] Jet bridges are positioned in a way that would be "stowed" by adjusting height, extension and rotation
- [ ] Ensure jet bridge reach (green arc) covers the gate and all doors for all available aircraft (partial coverage is not acceptable - use the "Rotate Range +90" button if required)
- [ ] "Jet Bridges Available" tick box selected (orange tick when selected) by tapping "File > Airport Properties > Jet Bridges Available"
