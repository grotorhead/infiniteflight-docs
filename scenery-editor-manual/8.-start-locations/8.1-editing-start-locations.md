# 8.1 Editing Start Locations



> If adding/moving start locations, a navigation database update will be required before the new start locations are reflected in-app



## How to see Aircraft Start Locations 

### 8.1.1

Before placing objects near aircraft start locations, it is recommended to turn on Aircraft Start Locations following these steps:



Step 1

: On the left of the screen, tap "View"



Step 2

: Then tap "Start Locations" (it will change to amber to indicate it has been selected)



Step 3

: Each start location will be represented by a blue dot. By zooming in on a start location you will be able to see the start location details including:

- Identifier (i.e. Terminal and stand number)
- Type (i.e. Gate, Tie-down, Misc or Hangar)
- Gate Size (i.e. maximum aircraft category)
- Ramp Operation Type (i.e. GA, Airline, Cargo or Military)



## Selecting and Placing a Start Location

### 8.1.2

Step 1

: Scroll up/down the list on the right of the screen to see the object repository (the "Library" tab **must**{.red} be selected)



Step 2

: Select "Start Location" under "Airport Items" by tapping it **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want to add the start location to (you may have to press and hold), this will place a white cursor **(2)**. Adjust this as required and then tap "Add Object" **(3)**



Tip

: You might need to "freeze" lines and pavements to avoid these being selected when tapping on your screen. To do this tap "Edit > Freeze All Lines / Freeze All Pavements"

## Changing Position/Orientation of a Start Location

### 8.1.3

The blue circle of the start location is the default position where an aircraft nose wheel will be located when spawning, follow the steps below to adjust the position and orientation of the start location to match its position IRL:



> The orientation of the start location **must**{.red} exactly match the orientation of the gate centerline



Step 1

: Select the start location by tapping on or near the blue circle *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: The circle will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected. If there are multiple objects in close proximity, a list will appear so you can select the object you want



Step 3

: Two circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Tap and hold on the circle **(1)** to move the start location or to change orientation:



| Circle | Function                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Center | Will move the start location by dragging your finger to the desired location |
| Outer  | Will change the orientation of the start location by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |
