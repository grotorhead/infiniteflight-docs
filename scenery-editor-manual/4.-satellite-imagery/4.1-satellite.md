# 4.1 Satellite



## Overview

### 4.1.1

Satellite imagery is used to assist Editors in creating accurate airports. SASPlanet is the recommended program, as it is capable of exporting orthophotos from various sources, such as Google, Bing or Yandex maps in varying quality. Files downloaded will be zipped, which can be extracted using Windows Explorer. A link to download this program is below:



> SASPlanet is only available on Windows and Linux. MacOS users will need to request orthophotos from other Editors
