# 6.2 Properties

### 6.2.1

Step 1

: Select the pavement by tapping on or near the pavement *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the pavement from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the pavement will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen

Step 4

: You can then adjust the following properties for pavements:



| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Surface Type         | You can change the surface type by tapping this              | Surface types that are a close match to the satellite imagery **must**{.red} be used (i.e. even if a bright asphalt looks like concrete color-wise, it **must**{.red} still be drawn as asphalt) |
| Texture Orientation  | Add any number between 0 and 360 to change the grain of the textures (orientated around true north) | This is particuarly useful to make the textures align with the direction of taxiways. You can also tap "Building" > "Auto Texture Orientation" from the management buttons on the left to do this *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) above)* |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the pavement                   | This **should not**{.red} be changed                         |
| Altitude             | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the pavement. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | The altitude is always based on the elevation of the airport (this **should not**{.red} be changed) |
| Name                 | You can name the pavement using this field                   | Pavements do not need to be named but it can help during the editing process to be able to distinguish between different pavements if they are labelled |
