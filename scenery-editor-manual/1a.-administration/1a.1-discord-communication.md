# 1A.1  Discord Communication

 

Tip

: Infinite Flight app related issues can be discussed within the Airport Editing Discord Channels for advice; however, for official support, the [IFC Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/support/17) **must**{.red} be used.



## General

### 1A.1.1    

Discord is a messenger app for teams to make work simpler, more pleasant and more productive. More information on how this app works can be found [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us).

 

### 1A.1.2

 The channels and their use is outlined in the table below:

| Channel              | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| #welcome              | Quick reference channel, containing various useful links and general guidance for editors |
| #server-rules        | Highlights the rules of the Scenery Editing Discord server   |
| #announcements       | Day-to-day posts (such as housekeeping) to be made in this channel by Staff and Moderators only |
| #general             | This is a channel for active Editors to engage in discussion regarding Scenery Editing, Infinite Flight, and aviation |
| #offtopic            | This is a channel to discuss things unrelated to Scenery Editing or Infinite Flight. All conversations **should**{.red} remain appropriate. *#offtopic* is a privilege and all members are subject to removal at any time if misused. This is for active members only |
| #airport-assignment  | For Editors of the rank Apprentice to request airport assignments. An Airport Moderator or Reviewer will then assign an airport to the Editor |
| #sas                 | Request satellite imagery of your airport here               |
| #request-peer-review | For Editors to be able to review each other's airports before it is submitted for Official Review. Editors **must**{.red} ensure that their airport is nearing completion before requesting a peer review and **must**{.red} provide the airport ICAO, along with a link to the respective airport's IFC topic when making a request. Peer reviews are optional but highly recommended *(see [12.1.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/12.-review-and-release/12.1-review-and-release-process#12.1.3) below)* |
| #help                | If Editors require support that cannot be found elsewhere, they can ask for it in this channel. Other Editors **must**{.red} only comment if they are 100% sure of the answer. If they are in doubt, they **must**{.red} leave this for Airport Moderators or Reviewers to respond to instead |
| #help-request        | Create a help ticket by clicking next to the corresponding role that you require. No messages **must**{.red} be sent in this channel, the *#help* channel can be used for this if required |



## Voice Channels

### 1A.1.3

Voice Channels (VCs) **must**{.red} only be used in accordance with the Discord Rules *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.-administration/1a.2-discord-rules#1a.2.1) below)*. 



### 1A.1.4

The use of VCs is **not required**{.red} and is at the sole discretion of the Editors seeking help or that want to have a conversation with fellow Editors about airport editing. Editors who wish to observe others in a VC for educational purposes may **ONLY** do so if **ALL** operational Editors in the VC have given consent. Observers **must not**{.red} distract from the active conversation and **should**{.red} remain muted.



### 1A.1.5

To open a VC, the following steps are to be followed:



Step 1

: Open the Airport Editing Discord and using the navigation bar on the left side of the screen, find the "Editing" tab



Step 2

: Under this, click the "help" or "general" VC* (represented with a speaker symbol next to it)



**Coordination with other Editors **should**{.red} be done in the respective Discord channel (i.e. *#help* or *#general*) before entering a VC*



### 1A.1.6

Below are some useful tips for VCs:

- You can see how many members currently occupy a VC at any time by noting the [00/10] channel count
- Selecting "Mute" (microphone symbol) means no one can hear you
- Selecting "Deafen" (headphones symbol) means you don't hear anyone else
- Always double-check your sound settings (i.e. Input = Mic and Output = Speaker)
- Connecting to a VC will act much like a phone call and can run in the background whilst editing
