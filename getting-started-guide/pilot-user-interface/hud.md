# Head Up Display (HUD)

![Head Up Display](_images/manual/frames/hud-v2.png)



1. The Outside Air Temperature (OAT) is shown here in Celsius

    

2. The speed tape shows the aircraft speed. Dependent on what aircraft you are flying, it may also show colors to signify flying too slow/fast (red) or at the correct speed (green)

    

3. Groundspeed (GS), Mach Number (M) and wind direction/speed are displayed here

    

4. The Attitude Indicator displays the aircrafts attitude in relation to the horizon, and also provides a Flight Path Vector (a green circle enabled in the [Systems menu](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems))

    

5. The altitude tape shows the aircraft altitude, current vertical speed (which is displayed at the bottom of the tape) and a turquoise bug that represents the altitude selected in the [Autopilot's](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/autopilot#autopilot) Flight Control Unit (FCU)

    

6. The power is displayed as a percentage, and the equivalent N1 (if applicable to the aircraft type) is displayed at the top of this

    

7. The Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) is displayed here and is used for [Navigation](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#navigation). There is a turquoise bug just like the altitude tape, which displays the selected heading on the aircraft FCU

   

8. The current bank angle is displayed at the top with the use of a pointer and scale. When the pointer is under the center line, this represents wings level or 0 degrees of bank. The lines either side of this indicate bank angle in 10 degree increments (i.e. 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50)
