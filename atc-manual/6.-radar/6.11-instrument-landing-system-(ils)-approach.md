# 6.11  Instrument Landing System (ILS) Approach

 

## What is an ILS Approach?

### 6.11.1    

The ILS consists of two beams, the Localizer (LOC), providing lateral guidance (left/right) and the Glideslope (G/S) providing vertical guidance (up/down).



### 6.11.2  

The cone at the end of a runway provides a **VISUAL AID** for both pilots and Controllers of where the LOC and G/S are, however it is important to remember that the LOC and G/S are not confined to the cone. The LOC and G/S are independent radio ‘signals’ that are sent out, and thus continue to go out. Aircraft can receive these signals and therefore intercept them - both within the cone or outside of the cone.

 

## Intercepting the LOC and G/S

### 6.11.3   

To intercept the LOC of an ILS, Controllers **should**{.red} issue an intercept heading *(for exceptions see [6.11.5](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.11-instrument-landing-system-(ils)-approach#6.11.5) below)*; this heading **should**{.red} be as close to 30 degrees as possible, offset from the runway designator *(see 6.11.3.1 below)*. The intercept heading needs to give the aircraft a good closing angle to get onto the LOC expeditiously and thus 10 degrees or less **should**{.red} be avoided. Although the standard method for determination of the intercept headings to be used **should**{.red} be based off the runway designator (e.g. for RWY 27, 30 degree intercepts would be headings 240 and 300 as shown in the image below), Controllers may need to take into account the actual runway heading if it is considered significantly different (e.g. KMIA RWY 08R has an actual heading of 092, therefore the ideal intercept headings would be 060 or 120 degrees).

### 6.11.4    

To intercept the G/S of an ILS, Controllers **must**{.red} issue an altitude that is below the G/S path *(see 6.11.4.1 below).* The typical G/S follows a 3 degree flight path angle that guides the aircraft to the runway threshold. At 1nm the G/S altitude would be 300ft AAL (above aerodrome level); at 2nm, 600ft AAL and so on.

### 6.11.5

Controllers may issue an ILS approach clearance at an appropriate position without an assigned intercept heading if the aircraft's filed STAR and/or Instrument Approach meet one of the following criteria:



- contains a reasonable* intercept angle to the final approach course or,
- joins the extended final at a distance of 20nm or greater



In all cases, an appropriate altitude **must**{.red} still be assigned to serve as the lowest authorized altitude until the aircraft is established on the localizer. If a Controller has an advanced understanding of an airport's specific ILS approach plate, the Controller may still issue a clearance without an intercept heading outside of the two conditions listed above. To do this, the Controller **must**{.red} have familiarized themselves with the instrument approach procedure and be able to visually determine when aircraft are established. If in doubt, Controllers **should**{.red} opt for issuing vectors instead *(see [6.11.3](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.11-instrument-landing-system-(ils)-approach#6.11.3) above)*.



**reasonable is considered anything that resembles the usual intercept angle of approximately 30 degrees and/or allows aircraft to turn onto final without difficulty*



## Determining the Intercept Altitude

### 6.11.6  

As already mentioned *(see [6.11.2](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.11-instrument-landing-system-(ils)-approach#6.11.2) above)*, the cone is a useful **VISUAL AID** that Controllers can utilize for the ILS or GPS approach. The cones have a standard length of about 11nm and thus the G/S altitude at this point is approximately 3500ft AAL. Although this will assist in determining the best altitudes to use for the intercept, it will also be affected by the following:

 

 -    Terrain

 -    Aircraft position

 -    Elevation of aerodrome

 

To ensure that aircraft intercept the G/S from below Controllers **must**{.red} use an altitude that is lower than the G/S at the point of interception *(see [6.11.4](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.11-instrument-landing-system-(ils)-approach#6.11.4) above)* – by convention, this tends to be 500ft lower but there is no hard rule on this. For example, Airport A has an elevation of 1000ft, therefore the G/S altitude at the end of the cone is approximately 4500ft. Assuming the aircraft is intercepting at the end of the cone, an altitude of 4000ft would be a sensible intercept altitude (based on no terrain to effect apart from the airport elevation). If the aircraft was to intercept further out than the cone, or even within the cone itself, then you will need to adjust the intercept altitude to allow the aircraft to not be above the G/S when intercepting. Without flying the approach before controlling and/or using approach plates, it will be difficult to determine the best altitudes that ensure terrain separation and a good intercept!



## Parallel Operations



> Reduced separation for Parallel Operations are only to be applied to aircraft that are on ILS or GPS approaches



### 6.11.7

Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that aircraft continue to meet the IFR separation criteria *(see [6.2.2](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.2-separation#6.2.2) above)* until they are established on the LOC or lateral guidance *(see [6.14.2](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.14-handover-to-towerunicom#6.14.2) below)*. Once established, the IFR separation criteria no longer need to be applied between aircraft aligned with parallel runways.



### 6.11.8

During parallel operations, lateral separation will always be lost first, therefore during the intercept, only vertical separation can be relied upon. If Controllers identify two or more aircraft that will end up being "parallel" during the final approach, there are two steps that **should**{.red} be followed to ensure the separation requirement above is met:

- ensure that all aircraft involved are **LEVEL** at the altitude you intend on clearing them at for the approach, separated by 1000ft as a minimum (ideally before the base turn)
- vector all aircraft so that they intercept the LOC or lateral guidance in-line with each other. This will mean that no aircraft has begun to descend on the G/S or vertical guidance (which could compromise vertical separation), until all the aircraft are established on the LOC or lateral guidance



**Example:**

In the following image *(see 6.11.8.1 below)*, both aircraft are level for the intercept (one at 3000ft and the other at 4000ft). In the example on the left, the aircraft will be established on the LOC before the G/S is met. However in the example on the right, the aircraft have not intercepted the LOC in-line with each other and thus the aircraft that was at 4000ft has already met the G/S and begun their descent. Subsequently, the vertical separation is lost before both aircraft are established on the LOC!
